# Memory surfaces improvement plan

**Status:** Proposed  
**Purpose:** Make Bear memory surfaces boring, inspectable, scoped, source-linked, and easy to correct or forget.  
**Hub:** [PLAN.md](PLAN.md)  
**Related:** [BEAR_MEMORY_REMAINING_WORK_PLAN.md](BEAR_MEMORY_REMAINING_WORK_PLAN.md), [MEMORY_TOOLS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](MEMORY_TOOLS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md), [DEN_CONTEXT_COMPACTION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](DEN_CONTEXT_COMPACTION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md), [CONTEXT_WINDOW_BUDGET_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](CONTEXT_WINDOW_BUDGET_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md), [PERSONALIZATION_PLAN.md](PERSONALIZATION_PLAN.md)

## Goal

Improve the model- and user-facing memory environment so agents can accurately answer:

1. What short-term conversation/context is present?
2. What persistent memory exists?
3. Why was this memory projected or recalled?
4. Where did a remembered fact come from?
5. How can a user correct, forget, rescope, or approve it?

This plan is about **surfaces and controls** around existing memory/recall systems. It should reuse the canonical SQLite memory store, derived recall, existing task/Docket state, and context-budget work where possible.

## Non-goals

- Do not make memory feel magical or human-like.
- Do not silently retain personal or secret-like facts.
- Do not create a second memory store for UI convenience.
- Do not mix task/workplan state into semantic memory.
- Do not add a new dependency where existing Den diagnostics, SQLite metadata, or Docket state can cover the need.

## Implementation constraints

- Prefer surfacing fields and state that already exist before adding schema.
- Keep task state in Docket/task-list surfaces; only promote project facts to semantic memory through explicit review.
- Treat `session_info` as the low-friction diagnostic entry point, but move anything large or expensive to a dedicated diagnostic tool.
- Keep user-facing answers short by default; detailed provenance and context attribution should be available on request.
- Make every destructive or externally visible memory operation explicit and reversible where practical.

## Workstreams

### 1. Context-budget status

Expose enough context-window information for agents and users to reason about context loss, compaction, and tool-schema overhead.

Deliverables:

- Current model context window and estimated request size.
- Remaining/reserved output budget.
- Component attribution: system/developer prompt, projected memory, recalled memory, transcript, tool schemas, tool messages, request overhead.
- Compaction status, source range, and summary pointers when available.
- A concise `session_info`/diagnostic view suitable for chat answers.

Acceptance checks:

- The agent can answer "how much context do you have?" without claiming the value is unavailable when the runtime knows it.
- The answer distinguishes context window from persistent memory.
- A developer can see which component is consuming the most context.

### 2. Distinct memory/context layers

Make layers visible and labeled instead of relying on prompt prose.

Deliverables:

- A grouped context/memory diagnostic view for:
  - current transcript;
  - projected memory;
  - turn-start recalled memory;
  - durable memory records;
  - task/Docket/workplan state;
  - tool descriptions and runtime instructions.
- Layer metadata: scope, lifetime, mutability, authority, and source.
- Model-facing labels that prevent projected memory from being treated as fresh user instruction.

Acceptance checks:

- The agent can explain whether a fact came from the current conversation, projected memory, durable memory, or task state.
- A user can inspect whether a fact is durable, transient, or task-local.

### 3. Provenance for memory facts

Every active remembered fact should be auditable.

Deliverables:

- Source identifiers: conversation/session/run/task where applicable.
- Timestamp and actor/asserter.
- Assertion mode: user-stated, assistant-inferred, system-generated, imported, or curated.
- Confidence and sensitivity classification.
- Provenance display in memory search/read/admin/member surfaces.

Acceptance checks:

- Given a remembered preference, the system can show where it came from.
- Inferred facts are visibly distinct from direct user statements.
- Sensitive provenance does not leak across scopes.

### 4. Candidate-memory confirmation flow

Make durable memory opt-in and lightweight.

Deliverables:

- Candidate-memory proposals for durable preferences, project facts, and recurring working agreements.
- Scope choices: session-only, work-surface/project, Bear-local profile, or curated/core review.
- A concise confirmation UI/prompt.
- Secret-like content refusal or quarantine path.

Acceptance checks:

- Personal or long-lived facts are not silently saved.
- The user can approve, reject, or rescope a memory candidate in one turn.
- Rejected candidates do not remain active guidance.

### 5. Forgetting and correction

Support reliable user correction without guessing or destructive surprises.

Deliverables:

- User intents: "forget that", "update that", "only remember this for this project".
- Search/selection flow for ambiguous matches.
- Supersession and deletion paths using existing lifecycle fields where possible.
- Audit behavior that preserves required operational traces without resurfacing forgotten content as active memory.

Acceptance checks:

- A corrected preference stops influencing future turns.
- Ambiguous deletion asks before changing memory.
- Superseded entries are marked inactive/stale and excluded from active projection/recall.

### 6. Expiry and lifecycle policy

Let temporary memory decay while durable user-approved preferences persist.

Deliverables:

- Consistent lifecycle use: session, short, durable, archive.
- Consistent status use: active, stale, superseded, archived.
- Review prompts for stale project/task context.
- Default expiry for transient goals, one-off experiments, and snapshots.

Acceptance checks:

- Temporary task context does not become durable personal memory.
- Stale project facts can be identified and retired.
- Durable approved preferences remain active unless corrected.

### 7. Relevance-ranked projection

Reduce prompt noise from irrelevant projected memory.

Deliverables:

- Projection ranking by current request relevance, scope, recency, confidence, and lifecycle status.
- Deprioritization of stale session summaries unless directly relevant.
- Projection diagnostics explaining why each block was selected.

Acceptance checks:

- Irrelevant old summaries are not projected by default.
- The agent can explain why a memory appeared in context.
- Relevant work-surface memory beats generic historical notes.

### 8. Tool-description compression

Spend fewer context tokens on verbose tool schemas while keeping exact validation available.

Deliverables:

- Compact tool summaries by default.
- Lazy expansion of full schemas only when needed by the runtime/provider path.
- Grouping by purpose and risk.
- Context-budget attribution for tool descriptions.

Acceptance checks:

- Common tool availability is understandable without large schema blocks.
- Exact schema details remain available before execution.
- Context-budget diagnostics show the tool-schema footprint.

### 9. Memory conflict detection

Flag contradictions instead of silently choosing one memory over another.

Deliverables:

- Detection when current conversation conflicts with active durable memory.
- User-facing resolution choices: update, supersede, keep both with scopes, or ignore.
- Conflict-resolution records tied to provenance.
- Projection/recall filters that avoid applying superseded guidance.

Acceptance checks:

- If memory says "prefers X" and the user now says "prefers Y", the agent asks before updating durable memory.
- Resolved conflicts mark old entries superseded or narrowed in scope.
- Superseded guidance stops appearing as active instruction.

### 10. Task memory vs personal memory separation

Keep "what we are doing" separate from "what the user prefers" and "who the user is".

Deliverables:

- Clear storage/projection rules for task state, project facts, user preferences, and person/identity facts.
- Docket/task-list state surfaced through task tools, not semantic-memory paths.
- Promotion/review path for project facts that become durable memory.
- UI labels that distinguish task/workplan artifacts from semantic memory.

Acceptance checks:

- Active plans are managed as task state, not personal memory.
- User preferences are not mixed with project implementation details.
- Shared/core updates require review instead of unilateral promotion.

## First implementation slice

Start with the smallest useful observability pass before changing memory behavior:

1. Audit existing runtime data for context budget, projected memory, recalled memory, task-list state, and memory-record metadata.
2. Extend `session_info` or the nearest existing diagnostic path to expose:
   - context-budget status when known;
   - active memory/context layers;
   - projected-memory counts and source labels;
   - whether compaction ran and which source range it summarized.
3. Add one small runnable check around the diagnostic serialization so missing/unknown fields degrade to explicit `unknown` values instead of disappearing.
4. Update this plan with the exact follow-up workstream owners once the audit identifies which fields are already available.

This slice should not add new memory-retention behavior. It only makes the current environment easier to inspect and debug.

## Suggested implementation order

1. Context-budget status.
2. Distinct memory/context layer diagnostic.
3. Provenance fields surfaced in search/read/UI.
4. Lifecycle and expiry consistency.
5. Forget/correct flow.
6. Candidate-memory confirmation flow.
7. Task-vs-personal separation rules.
8. Relevance-ranked projection.
9. Conflict detection.
10. Tool-description compression.

This order favors observability first, then safety controls, then quality-of-life and context-efficiency improvements.

## Open questions

- Which provenance fields already exist on `memory_records`, proposals, recall passages, and transcript artifacts?
- Should user-visible deletion physically remove content, mark records inactive, or do both depending on sensitivity?
- Which scope choices should appear in chat UI versus admin/operator UI?
- Can tool-description compression be implemented at the runtime/provider layer without changing model-facing tool validation?
- How much of this belongs in `session_info` versus a dedicated context/memory diagnostic tool?
